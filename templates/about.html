<h2 class="head">Our Philosophy:</h2>
<div class="p1">
	In ancient India, holistic living was a way of life. People inherently understood the balance of nature, the ways of the Universe and how the elements affected not just their physical health, but their mental well-being. It was understood that if they achieved harmony within, they would be at peace with their surroundings. On the fast track to progress, our world changed as did we; but deep within us we have always understood and upheld the beliefs and principles of our ancestors. To seek harmony, to balance themselves again, to be one with their surroundings, India has been known well to its holistic remedies like Yoga, Ayurveda and other Vedic Science. This is our philosophy which reflects in all of the programs we offer at Shree Mahesh Heritage rishikesh India.<hr>
